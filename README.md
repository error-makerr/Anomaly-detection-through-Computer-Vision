## Industrial Defect Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning
This repository contains the implementation of my thesis project: Computer Vision Based Deep Learning Approaches for Automated Visual Inspection and Defect Detection in Industrial Environments.

The project explores supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning paradigms across 16 models, and introduces a novel hybrid fusion framework that combines the strengths of MobileNetV2 and DINO. The system is designed to:

Achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on known defect types

Detect unknown defects through anomaly detection

Provide explainable predictions with attention-based heatmaps

Run efficiently on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)

This work contributes a deployment-ready solution for industrial quality assurance, bridging academic research and real-world manufacturing needs.
